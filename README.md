# 200 Days of Code

This repository contains the code for http://200doc.org, a project of the [Boston PHP](http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/) meetup group.  The site uses [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), an open-source Comtent Management System (CMS) written in PHP.  The site went live in March, 2015.

If you are interested in hosting a copy of this site, then set up the `drupal/` directory as your document root.  You will also need to set up a database; full [instructions](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install) are on the Drupal web site.

The main directory structure of this repository is determined by Drupal.  The files that are not part of Drupal core are in the subdirectory `drupal/sites/all/`:

- `sites/all/libraries`:  some widely used javascript libraries.
- `sites/all/modules`:  several contributed modules, available from [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module).
- `sites/all/modules/custom`:  a single custom module, describing some of the site structure.
- `sites/all/themes`:  themes that control the visual display of the site.

The custom module is generated by the [Feature](https://www.drupal.org/project/features) contrib module.  It describes the content types and views that make up the site.

As of this writing, the themes include the conrtributed [Zen](https://www.drupal.org/project/zen) base theme and the `daysofcode` subtheme, basically a single additional CSS file for styling the site.
